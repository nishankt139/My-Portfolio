    <p class="sec sec-new"><span class="sec sec-new op">“Only the disciplined are truly free.  The undisciplined are slaves to moods, appetites,
    and passions.”</span>—Stephen Covey</p>

    <p class="sec-new">What’s the difference between motivation and discipline?</p>
    <p class="sec-new">I like to think of discipline as “what to do” and motivation as “why to do.”
    Discipline has a Latin root, but the gist is it’s about teaching.  So I think of self-discipline as teaching yourself self-control and
    shaping your behavior, so that you’re not a slave to your motivations.</p>

    <h2 class="hero-new">Use Discipline to Bring Out Your Best.</h2>

    <p class="sec">

        <li class="sec-new"> Primal motivations served us at one point, but society’s changed what survival means.  For more precision, you can think of discipline
            as shaping your thinking, feeling, and doing to adopt a new behavior.
                
        </li>

        <li class="sec-new">
            Discipline serves you most when motivation says do otherwise.  At the end of the day though, I think a key is to find ways to link things to feeling good.

            You do more of what makes you feel good and less of what makes you feel bad.
